    <h1>Django:</h1>

    <p>
        Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications. 
        It is also called batteries included framework because Django provides built-in features for everything including 
        Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. When you’re building a website, you always need a similar
         set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for 
         your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use and that too for rapid development.
