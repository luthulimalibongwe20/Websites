        <img class="homepage-img" src="../images/web-dev1.png" alt="web-develop" >
    <p> Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, 
        and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, 
        however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.
        Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design,
        web publishing, web programming, and database management.
        It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

        Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of apps (web design). 
        The term development is usually reserved for the actual construction of these things (that is to say, the programming of sites).
    </p>  

    <p>
        The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:
        <ul>
            <li>Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet</li>
            <li>Development: Building the application from scratch.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Web Development can be classified into two ways:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Frontend Development</li>
            <li>Backend Development</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Frontend Development:</h2>
            The part of a website that the user interacts directly is termed as front end.
            It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Frontend RoadMap:</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
            <img class="about-map" src="../images/roadmap.jpeg" alt="_blank">
        <ul>
            <li>HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. 
                It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.
            </li>  <br>
            <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making 
                web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.

            </li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Frontend Frameworks and Libraries:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../html/angularJS.html">AngularJS</a></li>
            <li><a href="../html/react.html">React.js</a></li>

            <li><a href="../html/handlebar.html">Handlebars.js</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Backend Development:</h2>
        Backend is the server side of a website. 
        It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.

        <ul>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
