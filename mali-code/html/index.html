<h2>THAT IS EXACTLY ME!</h2>
    
<p class="home-p">Computer has always been my interest growing up. I didn't have access to a computer,but I used every opportunity I got when seeing one. 
Growing up I followed a career of IT but due to financial problems my wish was not pursued.
Today I'm given an opportunity to learn web development.
My occupation of choice is web designer, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them.
It’s never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and effort into this\ I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web designer 
I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over 
<br> <br>
time ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The requirements for this occupation vary with
 what kind of work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree. Though
many list a Bachelor of Science degree as the educational requirement. These are 4-year degrees, which mean they typically require 4 years of education beyond
 the completion of high school. Simple computer classes at this school could benefit in achieving this career but over all I don’t think they would help in becoming advanced in this occupation.
